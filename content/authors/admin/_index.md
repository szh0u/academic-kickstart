I am currently a Ph.D. student in Statistics at Texas A&M University. I am fortunate to be advised by Dr. Debdeep Pati and Dr. Anirban Bhattacharya.  My research interests center around statistical inference using non-standard constraints, Bayesian methods for complex objects, measurement error models, high dimensional probability, Bayesian asymptotics.
